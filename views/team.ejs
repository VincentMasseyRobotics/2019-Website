                <h3>An introduction</h3>

                <p style="text-align: left">
                    Our team, Mustangs 4903, was founded in 2013-2014 with the help of a vice-principal from Sandwich Secondary School (Team 772) who moved to Massey.
                    In our beginning years, we only competed in local events. However, in 2015, we won playoffs and advanced to Worlds.
                    During the season of 2018, we competed in Barrie, London, and Mississaugua, before competing at Worlds in the Curie Division.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Each year, we strive to improve from the foundations of our previous season.
                    With the aid of our wonderful mentors and teachers, many of our alumni have graduated to take part in various STEM related programs.
                    Many of our mentors are provided by our sponsors and student connections.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Within our team, we value determination, initiative, and creativity no matter which part of team youâ€™re on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A common driving force behind our team members is the thrill of competition, invention, and developing skills that one wouldn't usually learn in everyday classes.

                <h3>Community Connections</h3>
                <p style="text-align: left">
                    In the community, not only do we mentor students already part of FLL teams, but we showcase our robot at local feeder schools through demonstrations to encourage (further participation in STEM).
                    We show them what kind of community they can be a part of, and what feats they can accomplish through joining any FRC team.
                    Many of our mentors come from connections provided through students and sponsors alike. asdfasd
